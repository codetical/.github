## About Us

Codetical is an organization that was created by like-minded individuals as a place to collect knowledge, add some creations of our own, and hopefully leave the world a little better than it was.

Presently many of our projects are Minecraft related, but we are an ever evolving community that has many interests.  Some projects are original, some are forks and improvements to old projects, and some are yet to be discovered.  

Pull up a chair, have a look at our projects, and if you see something that peaks your interest, feel free to contribute with a pull request!
